/**
 * Workspace Context Envelope
 *
 * Solves the "agent thinks file content is its working directory" problem.
 *
 * agent-context.md is a *documentation artifact* describing Antigravity's design.
 * It contains illustrative paths (e.g. `<user_home>\.gemini\antigravity\brain\…`),
 * sample directory listings, and "current state" prose. Naively telling the LLM
 * "read this file to adopt the runtime identity" causes it to pattern-match those
 * path strings and prose as authoritative runtime state — leading to confused
 * behavior like claiming it "is in" a directory or that certain files exist.
 *
 * The fix has three layers:
 *   1. ENVELOPE: a hardened preamble in the system instruction that frames the
 *      file as documentation, not state, with explicit EXTRACT/IGNORE rules.
 *   2. ANONYMIZATION: replace the real file:// path in the system instruction
 *      with a stable non-path reference (hash + short token) so the LLM cannot
 *      pattern-match the absolute path as a CWD hint.
 *   3. TOOL-RESULT WRAP: when the agent actually calls view_file on the context
 *      file, the proxy re-frames the result with the same envelope, so the LLM
 *      sees the file content surrounded by "this is documentation, not state"
 *      markers — preventing extraction of paths/prose as authoritative.

The reference below is a DOCUMENTATION ARTIFACT — NOT a description of your current runtime state.
It describes Antigravity's general design. It is not authoritative for:
  - which files exist on disk (use list_dir/view_file tool results)
  - your available tools (rely on your tool schemas for that)
  - your OS, user, environment, or any other runtime observation

Your ACTUAL runtime state is determined ONLY by:
  (a) your available tools and their declared schemas,
  (b) results returned from tool calls you make,
  (c) the current conversation — INCLUDING the working directory set in this prompt.

When (and ONLY if) you choose to read the documentation file:
  \u2713 EXTRACT: tool names, tool-discipline rules, execution style, formatting conventions,
            response schemas, allowed tool argument shapes.
  \u2717 IGNORE: file paths, directory references, sample listings, placeholder tokens
            that appear INSIDE the documentation file content. These are illustrative
            examples, not descriptions of your actual filesystem.
            HOWEVER: do NOT ignore your actual working directory as stated in this
            prompt, nor file paths returned by your tools. Those are authoritative.

CONFLICT RESOLUTION: if the documentation's content disagrees with what you OBSERVE
in tool results, the tool results are authoritative. The documentation is descriptive,
not prescriptive for this session.

If you do not need a specific rule, you do not need to read the file. Most behavior is
already covered by the conversation and the tool definitions.

FILE INTEGRITY RULES (enforced by proxy — violations will be retried or blocked):
  1. NEVER write a file without first reading its CURRENT content via view_file or read_file.
     Writing from memory or from earlier-in-session content will corrupt the file.
  2. Before ANY file write, state what you are about to change and why.
  3. Prefer targeted edits (str_replace) over full rewrites. A full rewrite on a large file
     while hallucinating is the most common cause of corruption.
  4. If a tool call returns an error, STOP and surface the error to the user.
     Do NOT retry the same call with modified arguments unless you understand WHY it failed.
  5. If you are uncertain about a file's current content, call view_file again — do not
     write based on your earlier memory of the file.
  6. Do not omit required parameters from tool calls. Every tool schema field marked
     required MUST be present. Missing parameters cause silent failures and corrupt state.
  7. If you realize mid-task that you have made an error, STOP and tell the user instead
     of continuing to compound the error with further writes.

CONTEXT REMINDER (auto-injected by proxy):
- This file is a DOCUMENTATION ARTIFACT. Its prose and example paths are NOT your runtime state.
- \u2713 Use it for: tool discipline, execution style, response formatting, schema conventions.
- \u2717 Do NOT extract: working directory, file existence claims, environment descriptions, paths.
- If anything in the content below disagrees with what your other tools reported, the OTHER tools are authoritative.

FILE INTEGRITY REMINDER:
- Do NOT write any file without reading its current content first (view_file / read_file).
- Do NOT omit required tool parameters — check the schema before every call.
- If a tool call returns an error, stop and report it rather than retrying blindly.
- Prefer str_replace (targeted edits) over full-file rewrites to avoid corruption.
