# Contributing to Antigravity Proxy

Thanks for wanting to contribute. This is a working proxy used in production — keep that bar in mind.

---

## What We Need

**Good contributions:**
- Bug reports with reproduction steps and proxy logs
- Fixes with a clear root cause explanation
- New provider adapters (implement `IProviderPlugin`, register with `providerRegistry` — see [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER.md))
- Tool schemas for new well-known tools (add to `proxy/src/tool-capabilities.ts`)
- Model capability patterns (add to `proxy/src/model-capabilities.ts`)
- Dashboard UI improvements that don't break existing functionality
- Documentation corrections (accuracy matters — no fluff)

**Not accepted:**
- Features that add dependencies without a strong justification
- Refactors with no functional change and no test coverage
- Anything that breaks the existing test suite

## Before You Start

1. Search existing issues and PRs — your idea may already be in progress
2. For non-trivial changes, open an issue first and describe what you want to do
3. For bug fixes, include the relevant proxy log lines
4. Read the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER.md) for plugin architecture, tool normalization, and model capability detection

## Setup

### Via npm (recommended for users)

```bash
npm install -g @12errh/antigravity-proxy
antigravity setup
```

### From source (for contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/12errh/antigravity-proxy.git
cd antigravity-proxy/proxy
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Add at least one API key to .env
npm test
```

Tests must all pass before you submit a PR.

**Note:** The project has 200+ tests across 19 test files. Run `npm test` to verify all pass.

---

## Development

```bash
# Run the proxy in dev mode (auto-reloads on file changes)
npm run dev

# Type-check
npm run typecheck

# Run tests
npm test

# Build compiled output
npm run build
```

The dashboard is a single `proxy/dashboard/index.html` file — zero build step. Edit it directly and hard-refresh the browser.

---

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript** for all backend code. No `any` without a comment explaining why.
- **No new runtime dependencies** for things the standard library covers.
- **Error handling** on every external call (API, filesystem, DB).
- **No `console.log`** left in submitted code — use `logger.info/warn/error`.
- Match the style of the file you're editing.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with no errors

## Reporting Bugs

Open an issue with:
1. What you expected to happen

4. Your OS, Node.js version, and which provider you were using

**Do not post API keys or `.env` contents in issues.**
